## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project foundations: hexagonal package layout, tooling (ruff, mypy strict, pytest), CI, ADRs.
- Project catalog: `quant-project.toml` manifest (pydantic v2, JSON Schema export), registry of the
  ten portfolio projects, discovery with in-repo > registry > inferred precedence.
- Dependency graph: cycle detection, parallel execution layers, transitive impact analysis; edges
  are the union of declared dependencies and those detected by static analysis of the source.
- CLI: `qw list`, `qw graph` (text / mermaid / json / `--impact`), `qw schema`.
- Job engine: asyncio process runner (process-tree kill on timeout/cancel, CPU/RSS sampling), DAG-aware
  batches with bounded concurrency, retries with backoff for transient failures, run history in SQLite
  (versioned migrations), metric extractors and a data-driven failure-signature knowledge base.
- Environments: `pip list`-based inspection of a project's venv, venv creation and requirements install.
- CLI: `qw run`, `qw run-all`, `qw env status|setup`, `qw history`, `qw logs`.
- Config editor (libcst): lists a project's literal constants with type, value and the comment above
  them as help text; edits preserve comments, layout and Windows line endings byte for byte, merge
  dict/list/tuple edits element by element, verify every edit by reading it back, and keep a backup
  outside the project. Property-based tests run against the ten real config files.
- CLI: `qw config get | diff | set`.
